# PHP CMS blog system

This project was initially based on a project by my instructor, Edwin Diaz. I've made several changes as I've learned. There are many more changes to come as I make this project my own.

jquery and bootstrap-unminified have not been included in this repo, but jquery will be necessary to run this application. jquery.js can be added to /js and /admin/js prior to running.

A database password can be included by adding it in /includes/data.txt, which has also been ignored in this repo. Without having that file present, there will be many errors.
